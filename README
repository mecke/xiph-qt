XiphQT
======

XiphQT, the Xiph QuickTime Components, is a collection of QuickTime
and Mac OS X 'plug-ins' providing support for the Xiph.Org Foundation's
(http://xiph.org/) multimedia compression formats.


Building
========

The XiphQT source code is accompanied by a set of Xcode project files,
and can be built easily using Xcode GUI or 'xcodebuild' command line
tool. To build from sources source codes of a number of additional
libraries need to be placed in the ./external-libs folder (see below).

The latest version of XiphQT makes use of the following libraries:
ogg, vorbis, flac, speex, theora and theora-exp. Their source code can
be found on http://xiph.org/ .

To build using Xcode's xcodebuild command-line tool type with the
./build-macosx as the current working directory:

    > xcodebuild -target XiphQT -configuration Release

That should produce statically linked XiphQT.component bundle in the
./build-macosx/build/Release directory.

To only build decoder and importer components use type:

    > xcodebuild -target 'XiphQT (decoders)' -configuration Release


Installing
==========

The binary component bundle needs to be installed in
~/Library/Components (or /Library/Components for system-wide
installation). Create the folder if it doesn't exist.


Source code organisation
========================

./AppleSDK
	contains selected files from the CoreAudio SDK; these files are the
	base of the AudioCodec API

./CAFLAC
	FLAC AudioCodec files

./CASpeex
	Speex AudioCodec files

./CAVorbis
	Vorbis AudioCodec files

./OggImport
	Ogg QuickTime MovieImporter component files

./OggExport
	Ogg QuickTime Movie Data Export component files

./Theora
        Theora QuickTime ImageCodec component files

./common, ./utils and ./resources
	Functions, definition and resources shared between several components

./external-libs
        Source code of the external libraries should be placed here in
        the corresponding subfolders: ogg, speex, theora, vorbis, flac
        (using SVN repository all libraries except flac can be pulled
        automatically)

./build-macosx
        Xcode project files, for building for Mac OS X

./build-win32
        Win32 build files
